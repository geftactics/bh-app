    "description": "The first superstar produced by the breakbeat jungle movement, Goldie popularized drum’n’bass as a form of musical expression just as relevant for living-room contemplation as techno had become by the early ’90s. Goldie became one of the first personalities in British dance music, his gold teeth and b-boy attitude placing him leagues away from the faceless bedroom boffins who had become the norm in intelligent dance music. For the first time, England had a beat maestro and tough-guy head who could match the scores of larger-than-life hip-hop stars America had produced, and the high profile of drum’n’bass as the first indigenously British dance music made Goldie a figure of prime importance. After spending several years working on his production skills at Reinforced Records (the home of 4hero), he founded Metalheadz Records, which released seminal dark yet intelligent singles by Source Direct, Photek, J. Majik, Optical, Lemon D, Wax Doctor, and Peshay, among others. In 1995, Goldie released Timeless, one of jungle’s first and best full-length works of art. The album put him squarely at the top of the drum’n’bass heap — at least in the minds of critics and mainstream listeners — though his follow-up, SaturnzReturn, displayed an ambitious, personal side of Goldie hardly in keeping with jungle’s producer mentality.",

'Est 2003' his second album on the iconic Local Action label, leans back into his classic Garage roots. 'A440' a collaboration with tofubeats who is a Japanese production legend combines his style with a J Hip Hop twist. t q d, the supergroup formed with Royal-T and Flava D, continued to release and play together. \r\n\r\n2025 see's DJ Q continue this into another generation with several strands of his creativity running at once. Plus his weekly show on Kiss FM gives a platform to the next generation of Garage, Bass and House talent on a national platform. \r\n\r\nIn the live arena DJ Q's technical ability really shines through. His current live project digs deep into his archives, spinning a medley of House, Garage, Bassline, Jungle, Drum & Bass and more. It's the best way to witness Q's passion for the music he plays and experience his wide ranging technical ability.",

    "description": "It is over 30 years since Ian Ossia's first professional gig, at the then hugely  influential and extremely cool 'Venus' night in Nottingham (run by then Sasha's manager James Baillee), followed soon after with a spot at the up-and-coming  night in Mansfield 'Renaissance'. This night took many elements from Venus  but extended it until 6am (or later), which gave it the ability to get top guests,  such as David Morales, Danny Rampling, Jeremy Healy, Ten City, A Man called  Adam, and Dina Carrol as late night clubs were a rarity at the time. It also gave  Sasha his first residency after the 'Shelley' phenomenon of the early 90s  where he first made his name in a big way. All these factors combined to make  something rather special and Ian's residency started in June 1992, shortly after  the opening of the club. Having left behind a university degree to embark on his  DJing career, many precedents were set during those first 2 years at  Renaissance, and the 'Progressive House' scene was born. Labels such as  Guerilla Records (brainchild of later super producer William Orbit) and Strictly  Rhythm became huge, and the scene began to grow exponentially.  \r\nFrom here on in, Ian's name grew along with the club, and the sound that Ian  helped develop started to become an international scene. Renaissance started  the now commonplace event of a club tour, and these tours took Ian and his  sound to all corners of the globe including US, Australia, Asia, South America  and throughout Europe both east and west. He also had strong ties with the  Ministry, including a slot at the 2000 New Year's bash at the Millennium Dome,  where Ian played the main slot before Paul Oakenfold. \r\nAfter a long hiatus for the early years of his daughter's childhood, Ian rediscovered the love for the scene on a different tangent with the rise of Nu  Disco. This led to holding an event to bring over some of his favourite artists Dr  Packer and Late Nite Tuff Guy, and Downtown Disco was born. Ian's sets as  resident are the solid underbelly of the events, with his setswinning big plays on Soundcloud and getting the Downtown parties moving from opening doors.  Downtown Disco has won #1 Disco Event in the UK in the OGV public vote  awards two years running, and has been quoted as being the favourite event of  the year for Dr Packer and superstar resident Michael Gray. \r\nIan is a real DJ's DJ, known equally for his knowledge of music, his phenomenal  technical ability and his knack of feeling a crowd and taking them with him on his  blissful journey. His recent production 'Papas Stoned' received huge acclaim and  was #1 on Greg Wilson's '20 Choice Edits & Reworks 2020-2022'.",

Dave Clarke has also long embraced sounds outside staunch electronic dance, from Brian Jonestown Massacre and Idles, original UK punk and new wave to gothic favourites Bauhaus and through his own richly adventurous music; often defined by their darker and more abrasive sonic pace and visceral accents.
